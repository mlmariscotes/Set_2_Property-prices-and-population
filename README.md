### Property prices and population

Our goal is to identify the state with the best potential for business expansion based on property prices and population.

#### Postgres:

1. Calculate the percentage of property prices and population by state in relation to the total amount of property price and population. Is there any observable connection between property prices and population?
2. Identify the states with the highest and lowest average property prices.
3. Identify the states with the highest and lowest population.

#### Python:
1. Create a scatter plot of property prices vs. population.
2. Calculate the correlation coefficient between property prices and population. Use the df.corr() method for this task.
3. Create a box plot of the property price distribution for all states.
